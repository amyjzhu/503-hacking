# VSCode Plugin
This is the VSCode plugin's source code for our project.

Using VSCode, you can test the plugin by running a new instance of VSCode with the plugin via "F5".

There is two commands:
- `codemap.d3` to launch the d3 view.
- `codemap.server` to launch / connect to the background server and acquire the data.

## Why do you not use Typescript?
Because the skeleton example didn't work out of the box, and I couldn't get it to work properly.
