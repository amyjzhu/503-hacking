Simple prototype:
try playing around with a force layout
retain tracking for things that already exist
work on viz first, data collection later

Basic view will be boxes where you zoom in and out
if the boxes stay in place with the zoom, we need some kind of zoom level factor... like a snap zoom
once you've zoomed enough, you zoom to the next level
Potential for highlighting links
Links between different boxes
Buttons to switch between views


Zoom idiom 


what infomration do we need about classes?
- package-level info 
- name
- connections to other classes through each view
- methods
- each methods has connections to other methods in each view

- also though, methods can be colour-coded by class I think
