# VSCode Plugin

This is the VSCode plugin's source code for our project.

Using VSCode, you can test the plugin by running a new instance of VSCode with the plugin via "F5".

There is two commands:
- `codemap.d3` to launch the d3 view.
- `codemap.server` to launch / connect to the background server and acquire the data.
